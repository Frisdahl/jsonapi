			"description": "A new beer style from the North American continent. Black as a porter and hoppy as an IPA. Called a Cascadian dark ale or a Black IPA. The term “Cascadia” comes from the Cascade Mountain Range, which includes the area around British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, western Idaho and northern California. The taste is a mix of hops notes as: resin, pines , citrus and balanced against the dark malts giving notes such as chocolate and mild coffee. With carefully selected powerful hop varieties from the Americas, added dark malts, this beer achieves a delicious balance between hop aroma and malt fullness. Fermented at a temperature that allows the yeast to form fruity esters which provides a soft balance between the dark malts and hops. Should be enjoyed at 10-12°C, (50-54°F) in a Munkebo glass that highlights the aroma of American hops.",
